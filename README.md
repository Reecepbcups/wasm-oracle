# CosmWasm Oracle

This is a data oracle contract built on the CosmWasm smart contract platform. It is designed with generalization in mind, allowing for a developer to submit and data to the contract for their needed use case.

To submit data, you just have to modify the data-feeder application with the specific endpoints and logic for each individual to run. For the best outcome, you should take the average if you query multiple sources.

Example use cases:

- Token & Commodity prices
- Sports Game points
- Weather
- Stock prices

All of these are possible with this oracle contract.
